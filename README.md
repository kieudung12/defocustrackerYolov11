# DefoscusTrackerAI - A generalized framework for automated defocus particle detection

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/gnclctnh/defocustrackerAI-notebooks/blob/main/DefocusTrackerAI_Ready2Use.ipynb)

This project is part of the ISPIV 2025 contribution and a journal publication currently under review.

## Overview

DefocusTrackerAI is a ready-to-use generalized framework for the automated detection of defocus particle images, including:
    - Astigmatic and non-astigmatic particle images
    - Sprays and droplets
    - Potentially to non-spherical particles, cells and micro-organisms

## Get started 

First, you need to download the YOLOv9-m model weights that we trained for defocus particle images. The weights for the YOLOv9-m model trained for defocus particle images is available in the following link: 
    [**YOLOv9-M-DPTAI**](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1yqtbfV1t14viiFXcD4B8w5NmMxR7RCtW)

Second, use the 'run colab button' on this README file
